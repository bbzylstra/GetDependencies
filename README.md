# GetDependencies
Python Code that returns the dependencies of a Python Project

Just drop get_dependencies.py in the top level of your project and run! After it finishes it will output a text
file called dependency_list.txt. Open it up and make sure that the dependencies look correct, the code will sometimes grab words from strings if they include the keywords "import" or "from".
